# Pulsox

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> Pulse oximeters are electronic devices capable of measuring blood oxygen concentration levels as well as heart beat rate. Although they originally found their use only in medical institutions, the COVID-19 pandemic led to rise in demand for such devices. Naturally, prices shot up through the roof with people being forced to buy them at 3-4x the prices to save their dear ones' lives. </p>
<p> Pulsox is an IoT based pulse oximeter capable of detecting heart rate as well as oxygen concentration. The data is displayed locally in the LCD display as well as sent to the Blynk IoT platform. This data can be visualized in real-time through an app.
